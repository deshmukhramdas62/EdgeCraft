Animal models are used to assess the potential toxicological effects of new substances on various organ systems, including the liver, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. By simulating human exposure to these substances, researchers can detect harmful effects and determine safe dosage levels. This application is particularly important for regulatory compliance, as animal-based toxicity testing is often a prerequisite for obtaining approval from agencies such as the FDA. These studies help to prevent public health crises and ensure that products are safe for human use.<p>As new chemical entities and biopharmaceuticals emerge, the demand for effective and reliable toxicity testing continues to rise. The development of advanced animal models that better reflect human physiology is driving improvements in toxicity testing procedures. Moreover, as public concern about animal welfare grows, there is increasing interest in the development of alternative testing methods. Nonetheless, animal models remain a critical component of toxicity testing, and their role is unlikely to diminish in the near future due to their proven effectiveness and regulatory acceptance.</p><h3>4. Parasitological Study</h3><p>Experimental animal models are extensively used in parasitological studies to understand the life cycle, pathology, and treatment of parasitic diseases. Animal models are essential for studying parasites such as malaria, leishmaniasis, and toxoplasmosis, as well as for evaluating the efficacy of antiparasitic drugs and vaccines. These models help researchers simulate infections in a controlled environment, allowing them to test potential treatments, study host-parasite interactions, and explore new diagnostic methods. Parasitic diseases continue to pose significant health threats globally, particularly in developing countries, and animal models are a key tool in combating these diseases.<p>The parasitological study segment is expected to grow due to the increasing prevalence of parasitic infections, particularly in the wake of global climate change and the movement of populations across borders. Research into parasitic diseases is also gaining momentum with advancements in genetic engineering and genomic sequencing technologies. Animal models will continue to be an integral part of efforts to develop more effective treatments and vaccines, improving public health outcomes worldwide. Furthermore, as drug resistance becomes a growing concern, animal models will play a critical role in understanding the mechanisms of resistance and developing strategies to overcome it.</p><h3>5. Hereditary Disease Study</h3><p>Hereditary disease studies rely heavily on experimental animal models to investigate the genetic basis of inherited disorders. Animal models, particularly genetically modified organisms (GMOs), are used to replicate human genetic diseases and explore the effects of specific genetic mutations. These models allow researchers to investigate the pathophysiology of hereditary conditions, including cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease, and to test potential genetic therapies.
